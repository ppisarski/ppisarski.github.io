Hello! My name is Pawel Pisarski. 
I am a data scientist and analytics professional.

The field of data science is constantly evolving which is what makes it so interesting.
I wanted to finally start contributing to the data science community 
by sharing some of my ideas and observations I made 
over the years while working on neat projects.

Stay tuned for more posts.
